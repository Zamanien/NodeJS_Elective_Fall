                    Short introduction to HTTP.<br>

                <p>HTTP stands for <b>H</b>yper <b>T</b>ext <b>T</b>ransfer <b>P</b>rotocol.
                   The HTTP protocol is used across countless web pages on the World Wide Web.
                   The purpose of HTTP is to achieve communication between server & client on the WWW.
                   This is done through HTTP request methods.<br><br>

                   HTTP is stateless. This means that each time a connection is established, there are no memories of past communication.<br>
                   This is also why, sites like Facebook uses Cookies (to remember your login & log your credentials - information).  
                </p>

                <h5>HTTP Request methods</h5>
                <p>
                    <ul style="list-style-type:none;">
                        <li>GET method</li>
                            <ul style="list-style-type:none;">
                                <li>
                                    The GET method is used everytime a webpage is loaded. The client (often browsers) send a GET request to the website (web-server) in which the client asks for the relevant data in order to load a specific website.<br>
                                    It should be noted that the client sends a request for a <i>representation</i> of the resource. The GET method only <i>retrieves</i> data and is also defined as a safe method.
                                </li>
                            </ul>
                        <li>PUT methods</li>
                            <ul style="list-style-type:none;">
                                <li>
                                    The PUT method is used to update specific resource / resources. If the request points towards an existing resource, then that resource should be updated with the new data.<br>
                                    If the request points at a non-existing resource, then it will create the resource. The PUT method is defined as idempotent. 
                                </li>
                            </ul>
                        <li>POST method</li>
                            <ul style="list-style-type:none;">
                                <li>
                                    The POST method is used to send. When logging into a website, the client (browser) sends a POST request as the user has filled out the login formular. Like the PUT method, the POST method is also considered as idempotent.
                                </li>
                            </ul> 
                        <li>DELETE method</li>
                            <ul>
                                <li>
                                    As the name hints, the DELETE request will simply delete the specified resource.
                                </li>
                            </ul>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                <p>Besides the ones listed above, there are also: <i>HEAD, OPTIONS, TRACE, CONNECT & PATCH</i>, which we won't cover as they are not relevant for us.</p>

                <h6>Scenario:</h6>
                <p>
                    1. User searches for an article on [Wikipedia.com](http://wikipedia.com). 
                    2. The browser sends a GET request to the Wikipedia Web-server, which will - if it exists - find the correct response in the correct format. Often just HTML file & pictures. 
                    3. The Web-server returns the correct files and information, which is called a HTTP Response
                    4. The browser interprets and displays the response to the Client.
                </p>
                

                <h5>HTTP Status Codes</h5>
                <p>The status codes are the response from the server. One of the most recognisable status code is <b>404</b>.<br>
                    The status codes:</p>
                <ul style="list-style-type:none;">
                    <li>100 - 199 | Informal Response</li>
                    <li>200 - 299 | Succesful Response</li>
                    <li>300 - 399 | Redirects</li>
                    <li>400 - 499 | Client Errors</li>
                    <li>500 - 599 | Server Errors</li>
                </ul>
